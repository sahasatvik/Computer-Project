\problem The {\em 8 queens puzzle} involves placing $8$ queens on an $8 \times 8$ chessboard such that no two queens
threaten each other, i.e.\ no two queens share the same rank, file or diagonal. It was first published by the chess
composer {\it Max Bezzel} in 1848. This puzzle has $92$ solutions, including reflections and rotations.
Below is one of them.
\[\chessboard[boardfontsize=25pt,
			  setpieces={Qa5, Qb3, Qc1, Qd7, Qe2, Qf8, Qg6, Qh4},
			  showmover=false,
			  arrow=to, linewidth=0.7pt, shorten=-1pt,
			  pgfstyle=straightmove]\]

The {\em n queens puzzle} is an extension of this puzzle, involving $n$ queens on an $n \times n$ chessboard.
Count the total number of solutions for the {\em n queens puzzle}, including reflections and rotations.
