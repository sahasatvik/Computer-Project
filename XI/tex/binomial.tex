\problem The \textit{binomial coefficient \footnotemark} of two integers $n \ge k \ge 0$ is defined as follows.
\begin{equation*}
	\binom{n}{k}	\; = \;  \frac{n!}{k! (n-k)!} 
\end{equation*}
\footnotetext{
	They are given this name as they describe the coefficients of the expansion of powers of a binomial, according to the \textit{binomial theorem}.
	\begin{equation*}
		(x + y)^{n}	\;=\;  \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k}x^{n-k}y^k
	\end{equation*}
}
Here, $n!$ is the \textit{factorial} of $n$, defined as follows.
\begin{equation*}
	n!	\;=\;   1\times 2\times 3\times \,\cdots\, \times (n-2)\times (n-1)\times n
\end{equation*}
Compute the binomial coefficient for two given integers.
