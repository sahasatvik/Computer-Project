\problem Analyse the frequency of each letter in the english alphabet appearing in a given file. Store the results
in a different file.

\solution
All that has to be done here is reading the contents of a file, counting the occurences of each character, then tabulating
the results before writing them to another file. Here, the characters have also been sorted based on their frequencies.
