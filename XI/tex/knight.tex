\problem A {\em Knight's Tour} is a sequence of moves of a knight on a chessboard such that 
the {\em knight} visits every square only once. If the knight ends on a square that is one knight's move
from the beginning square, the tour is {\em closed} forming a closed loop, otherwise it is {\em open}.

There are many ways of constructing such paths on an empty board. On an $ 8\times 8$ board, there are no less
than $26,534,728,821,064$ {\em directed\footnote{Two tours along the same path that travel in opposite directions are counted separately, as are rotations and reflections.} closed} tours. Below is one of them.
\[\chessboard[boardfontsize=25pt,
			  setfen=8/8/8/8/3N4/8/8/8 - - - 0 0,
			  showmover=false,
			  arrow=to, linewidth=0.7pt, shorten=-1pt,
			  pgfstyle=straightmove,
			  markmoves=\ktour]\]

Construct a {\em Knight's Tour} ({\em open} or {\em closed}) on an $n \times n$ board, starting from
a given square.\\

{\em (Mark each square with the move number on which the knight landed on it.
Mark the starting square $1$.)}\clearpage
