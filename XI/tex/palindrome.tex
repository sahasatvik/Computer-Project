\problem A {\em palindrome} is a sequence of characters which reads the same backwards as well as forwards.
For example, {\em madam}, {\em racecar} and {\em kayak} are words which are palindromes. Similarly, the sentence {\em``A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!"} is also a plaindrome.

Analyze a sentence of input and display all {\em words} which are palindromes. If the entire {\em sentence} is also a palindrome, display it as well.\\

{\em (A word is an unbroken sequence of characters, separated from other words by whitespace. Ignore single letter words such as {\em I} and {\em a}.
Ignore punctuation, numeric digits, whitespace and case while analyzing the entire sentence.)}
