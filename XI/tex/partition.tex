\problem A {\em partition} of a positive integer $n$ is defined as a collection of other positive integers such that
their sum is equal to $n$. Thus, if $(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k)$ is a partition of $n$,
\begin{equation*}
	n	\;=\;	a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_k 			\tag{$a_i \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$}
\end{equation*}

Display every {\em unique partition} of an inputted number.

\solution This problem can be solved elegantly using {\em recursion\footnote{Recursion occurs when a thing is defined in terms of itself or of its type.}}.
