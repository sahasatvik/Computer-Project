\problem A {\em partition} of a positive integer $n$ is defined as a collection of other positive integers such that
their sum is equal to $n$. Thus, if $(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k)$ is a partition of $n$,
\begin{equation*}
	n	\;=\;	a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_k 			\tag{$a_i \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$}
\end{equation*}

Display every {\em unique partition} of an inputted number.

\solution This problem can be solved elegantly using {\em recursion\footnote{Recursion occurs when a thing is defined in terms of itself or of its type.}}. Note that when partitioning a number $n$, we can calculate the partitions of $(n - 1)$ and append $1$ to each solution. Similarly, we can append $2$ to partitions of $(n - 2)$, $3$ to partitions of $(n - 3)$, and so on. By continuing in this fashion, all cases will be reduced to the single {\em base case} of finding the partitions of $0$, of which there are trivially none.

There is a slight flaw in this algorithm --- partitions are often repeated. This can be overcome by imposing the restriction that each new term has to be of a lesser magnitude than the previous. In this way, repeated partitions will be automatically discarded.

\algorithm
{\tt main (target:Integer)}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item	Call {\tt partition(target, target, "")}.
	\item	{\bf Exit}
\end{enumerate}
{\tt partition (target:Integer, previousTerm:Integer, suffix:String)}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item	If {\tt target} is $0$, display {\tt suffix} and {\bf return}.
	\item	Initialize a counter {\tt i} to $1$.
	\item	If {\tt digits[d]} exceeds $1$, the number does not have {\em unique digits}. Display a suitable
			message, and {\bf exit}.
	\item	Discard the last digit of {\tt number} by performing an integer division by $10$ and storing
			the result back in {\tt number}.
	\item	The number has {\em unique digits}. Display a suitable message.
	\item	{\bf Exit}
\end{enumerate}
