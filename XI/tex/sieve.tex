\problem The {\em Sieve of Eratosthenes} is a simple, ancient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to any given limit.
It does so by iteratively marking as composite the multiples of each prime, starting with the first prime number, $2$.

Implement the {\em Sieve of Eratosthenes} to display primes upto a given limit, as well as the number of primes calculated.
