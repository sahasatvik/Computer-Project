\problem Calculate the \textit{square root} of a given positive number, using only \textit{addition}, \textit{subtraction}, \textit{multiplication}
and \textit{division}.

\solution
The problem of finding the \textit{square root} of a positive real number $k$ is equivalent to finding a positive root of the function 
$f : \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0} \to \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0} $
\begin{align*}
	f(x) \;=\; x^2 - k
\end{align*}
This problem can be solved using \textit{Newton's method}. \textit{Newton's method} is an iterative process for finding a root of a general function
$f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ by creating an initial guess, then improving upon it. 
\par
Let $f'$ denote the derivative of the function $f$. Thus, the equation of the tangent to the curve $f(x)$, drawn through the
point $(x_n, f(x_n))$ is given by the following equation.
\begin{align*}
	y \;=\; f'(x_n)(x - x_n) + f(x_n)
\end{align*}
The idea here is that the $x$-\textit{intercept} of this tangent will be a better approximation to the root of the function $f$. Setting
$y = 0$, solving for $x$ and renaming it to $x_{n+1}$ yields the following expression.
\begin{align*}
	x_{n+1} \;=\; x_n \,-\, \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}
\end{align*}
Plugging in the required function for this problem, we have
\begin{align*}
	x_{n+1} \;=\; x_n \,-\, \frac{x_n^2 - k}{2x_n}
\end{align*}
Simplifying, we arrive at our expression for the term $x_{n+1}$ in our iterative process.
\begin{align*}
	x_{n+1} \;=\; \frac{1}{2} \left( x_n \,+\, \frac{k}{x_n} \right)
\end{align*}
This is the sort of simple expression we have been looking for, involving only one addition and two multiplications per iteration.
As $n$ becomes very large, the term $x_n$ approaches the \textit{square root} of $k$.
