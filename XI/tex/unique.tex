\problem An $n$ digit integer $(a_1a_2\dots a_n)$, where each digit $a_i \in \{0, 1, \dots, 9\}$,
is said to have {\em unique digits} if no digits are repeated, i.e., there is no $i, j$ such that $a_i = a_j$ ($i \neq j$).

Verify whether an inputted number has {\em unique digits}.

\solution The problem involves simply counting the number of occurences of each digit in the given number and checking whether any of them exceed $1$.
