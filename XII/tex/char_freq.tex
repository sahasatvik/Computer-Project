\problem Analyse the frequency of each letter in the English alphabet appearing in a given file. Store the results
in a different file.

\solution
All that has to be done here is reading the contents of a file, counting the occurrences of each character, then tabulating
the results before writing them to another file. Here, the characters have also been sorted based on their frequencies.

\algorithm
\texttt{main (fromFile:String, toFile:String)}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Create a \texttt{CharacterCounter} object, pass it \texttt{fromFile}, and assign it to \texttt{cc}.
	\item Call \texttt{cc->writeReportToFile(toFile)}.
	\item \textbf{Exit} 
\end{enumerate}
\vspace{8mm}
\texttt{CharacterCounter (fromFile:String)}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Read all the lines from the file \texttt{fromFile} and store the resultant \texttt{String} in \texttt{fileData}.
	\item Initialize a \texttt{26} row \texttt{Character} array \texttt{letters}, as well as a \texttt{26} row
		\texttt{Integer} array \texttt{letterCount}.
	\item For each letter \texttt{c} $\in \{a, b, \dots, z\}$:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Store \texttt{c} in an empty row in \texttt{letters}. 
		\item Count the number of occurrences of \texttt{c} in \texttt{fileData}. Store the result in the corresponding
			row in \texttt{letterCount}.
		\item Move to a new row in \texttt{letters} and  \texttt{letterCount}.
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Store the sum of all entries in \texttt{letterCount} in the variable \texttt{totalLetters}.
	\item Sort the entries in \texttt{letters} and \texttt{letterCount}, in descending order of the entries in \texttt{letterCount}
		using \textit{bubble sort}.
	\item \textbf{Define} the function \texttt{CharacterCounter::writeReportToFile(toFile)} and \textbf{return} the resultant object.
\end{enumerate}
\vspace{5mm}
\texttt{CharacterCounter::writeReportToFile (toFile:String)}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Open the file pointed to by \texttt{toFile}. Start from the beginning in write mode.
	\item Write all entries in \texttt{letters} and \texttt{letterCount}, formatted to include the ratio of the
		entry in \texttt{letterCount} to \texttt{totalLetters}.
	\item Write \texttt{totalLetters} to \texttt{toFile}, along with any entry in \texttt{letters} whose corresponding entry in
		\texttt{letterCount} is zero.
	\item Close the file \texttt{toFile}.
	\item \textbf{Return} 
\end{enumerate}
